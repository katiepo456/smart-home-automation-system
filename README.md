# Smart Home Automation System
## CSI-340-01: Cole Heigis & Katie James

### About
The Smart Home Automation System was designed to put smart home owners in control of their own home. This system provides a controller that allows for control, scene management, and system notifications for devices in the user’s smart home. By supporting devices from different manufacturers, the system allows for integration of various devices to keep light control, door locking, and temperature management all in one place. The Smart Home Automation System employs various design techniques in order to provide flexibility and convenience to smart home management.

### Features
The Smart Home Automation System includes the following features:
- Turning devices (lights, locks, etc.) on and off.
- Adding devices from different manufacturers, which have different implementations but behave uniformly from the user’s perspective.
- Creation of “scenes” that trigger actions for multiple devices (ex: a “Goodnight” scene turns the lights off and locks the doors).
- Decorating devices to expand their basic functionality, such as an energy saving feature for light bulbs.
- Notifying the user via mobile notifications and email about device actions (ex: a light turned off, a door unlocked, etc.).
- Ability to integrate new devices, manufacturers, and notification methods without modifying the core system.

### Design Patterns
The Smart Home Automation System includes the following design patterns:
1. Factory Method
2. Adapter Pattern
3. Command Pattern
4. Observer Pattern
5. Composite Pattern
